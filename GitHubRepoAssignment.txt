I created a repository on Github.com

Then I created a folder for the assignment on my desktop through terminal

I initialized a git repository and made a file readme.md explaining that I had created it.I checked the status with git status, added the commit with a message and then logged it to double check it. 

I pushed the changes onto the Github repository i created earlier from my terminal and then now i am creating the text file explaining it.
